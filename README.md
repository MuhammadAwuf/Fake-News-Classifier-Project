# Fake News Classifier – Internship Project

This project detects whether a given news article is Fake or Real using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

## 📦 Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes
- NLTK
- Streamlit

## 📁 Project Structure
- NewsClassifier1.ipynb → model building
- logistic_model.pkl → trained model
- tfidf_vectorizer.pkl → saved vectorizer
- app.py / App.py.ipynb → Streamlit UI
- requirements.txt → dependencies

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Launch app:
    streamlit run app.py
3. Paste a news article and get the prediction (Fake or Real)

## 📊 Accuracy
- Logistic Regression: 99%
- Naive Bayes: 94%
